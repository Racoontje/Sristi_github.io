            <p>
                She is shy, but also energetic.. 
                She is afraid of love so that’s why giving her reassurance, love,  patience, positivity, and effort should be at least bare minimum! 
                I will love her in the ways she have always wanted! The ways she have always deserved in the means that leaves no trace of doubt in her beautiful mind that it is home!
                I will be her sun to brighten her day and when the night falls I will be her moon to brighten her  in the her darkest moment!
                I never feel like I’m wasting time with her. We could sit in silence for hours and it would still feel so full. I’m so thankful for her!</p>
